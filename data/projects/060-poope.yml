  "<p>
  Through a partnership with the Smithsonian Institution National Zoo, REDO is building innovative solutions for zoos to manage their animal manure and food waste. Our composting solutions set the Gold Standard for zoos to make use of their waste products. 
  We see waste and doo not as a problem, but as unique assets with educational, social, environmental, and financial benefits.
