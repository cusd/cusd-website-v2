description:
  "<p>The SVI team is working to research, design, and implement sustainable resource management systems in a small, resource-limited village in the Chikkaballpur district of Karnataka, India. Among the core solutions SVI intends to deliver are adequate water storage, sustainable energy practices, solid waste management, and a cost-efficient irrigation system.</p>

  <p>As water is the most essential and critical component of the multidimensional issues the village faces, this semester will be focused on research and design behind rainwater harvesting systems to provide villagers with a sustainable source of clean water. SVI will simultaneously work on collecting the necessary data to establish a long term strategy for the project./p>"
