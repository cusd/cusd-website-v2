lede: "The Upson Hall team is working on high-efficiency HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) sensors using various tracking technologies and machine learning that will be implemented during the upcoming Upson Hall renovation."
description: "<p>The Upson project uses intelligent occupancy sensing to control the heating system for academic (single professor) offices. Air conditioning and ventilation make up 53% of energy use in commercial buildings. Using cutting edge technologies including machine learning, smartphone applications, sensors, and wearables we are designing a system that will accurately predict whether a professor is in their office and turn their heating on/off based on this data. Upson applies computer science and electrical engineering skills to develop a system that offers substantial energy savings.</p>"
