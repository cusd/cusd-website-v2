lede: "Members of the Climate Action Plan project worked closely with the Cornell Facilities department and Cornell's Campus Sustainability Office to help advance the university-wide action plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035.

  CAP teams have done a feasibility study on the placement of a wind turbine on campus property and researched ways to make the currently existing on-campus hydropower plant more modern and efficient, as well as looking into innovative ways to educate the public on alternative energy.

  The CAP project is always interested in determining new ways to pursue climate neutrality for the Ithaca campus by forming new partnerships on campus. In potential future projects, CAP aims to continue making an impact by taking on and helping to accomplish other actions from Cornell's climate action plan.
